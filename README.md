# CustomPrintScreen
The project will allow you to chose what screen you want to take screen of(if you have multiple monitors) and after the selection, saves the screen automatically to desktop. The project will(not done yet) allow you to crop the screenshot and than save it. 

The program works in two modes:
Simple - if you press the print screen button and if you have one monitor, the screen will be saved to your desktop. If you have multiple monitors the window will pop up to ask you which monitor would you like to take screenshot of. 
Advanced(not done yet) - differs from simple with that you run it with Ctrl + Print Screen. If you have one monitor only than it will open a crop tool automatically, else it will show you the selection of screens with possibility to crop or edit.
